## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep carmine (#960018), reflecting reliability, expertise, and the auto body work itself, with slight saturation.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated rose-tinted off-white (#F4E9EB). This complements the deep red, avoiding harshness and helping content stand out.
- Accent color: A deep red close to the primary color (#780000), is used to differentiate CTAs and visual accents.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for body and headline, with a modern and neutral aesthetic.
- Clean, single-column layout optimized for mobile conversion, prioritizing the call-to-action section.
- Use of simple, clear icons to visually represent the key benefits (e.g., a calendar for booking, a phone for 'Call Now').
